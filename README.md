========

**Nextcloud SQL user authentication.**

![](https://github.com/nextcloud/user_sql/blob/master/screenshot.png)

## Getting Started
1. SSH into your server

2. Get into the apps folder of your Nextcloud installation, for example /var/www/nextcloud/apps

3. Git clone this project
```
git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/user_sql.git
```

4. Login your Nextcloud as admin

5. Navigate to Apps from the menu and enable the SQL user backend 

6. Navigate to Admin from menu and switch to Additional Settings, scroll down the page and you will see SQL User Backend settings

## Integrations

### WordPress
Thanks to this app, Nextcloud can easily integrate with Wordpress.

In the Nextcloud Column Settings of SQL User Backend, configure it as
```
Table: wp_users
Username Column: user_login
Password Column: user_pass
Encryption Type: Joomla > 2.5.18 phppass
```

### JHipster
It is very easy to integrate Nextcloud with JHipster.

Follow the Using the Database instructions in [Using Jhipster in development](http://www.jhipster.tech/development/) to configure your database. Assume you chose MySQL as JHipster database.

In the Nextcloud Column Settings of SQL User Backend, configure it as
```
Table: jhi_users
Username Column: login
Password Column: password_hash
Encryption Type: Joomla > 2.5.18 phppass
User Activate Column: activated
Email Column: email
```

## Features
Currently, it supports most of postfixadmin's encryption options, except dovecot and saslauthd.
It was tested and developed for a postfixadmin database.

Password changing is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the Admin area.
Caution: user_sql does recreate password salts when using the encryption types "system","password_hash" and "Joomla2". Not recreating password salts imposes a security risk. 
Password salts should be newly generated whenever the password changes.

The column autocomplete works only for MySQL and PostgreSQL database which is used to validate form data.
If you use other database use *occ* command to set the application config parameters with domain suffix.

For example to set 'sql_hostname' parameter in default domain use:

```occ config:app:set user_sql 'sql_hostname_default' --value='localhost'```

- sql_hostname
- sql_username
- sql_password
- sql_database

- sql_driver
- col_username

- col_active
- col_displayname
